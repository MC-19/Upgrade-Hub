# Hack The Box - Network Enumeration with Nmap

## Introduction

Enumeration is a vital phase in penetration testing, focused not only on accessing a target system but on discovering all possible attack vectors. Here are key aspects:

1. **Purpose of Enumeration**: Identify and understand attack paths by gathering detailed information on services and configurations.
2. **Tool Limitations**: Automated tools like Nmap are valuable but have constraints, such as timeouts that may miss open ports.
3. **Manual Enumeration**: Direct interaction with services often reveals critical information missed by automated scans.
4. **Configuration Issues**: Many vulnerabilities arise from misconfigurations and poor security practices, providing easy entry points.
5. **Interpreting Tool Results**: Adjusting and actively interpreting tool outputs prevents overlooking hidden details.
6. **Knowledge over Tools**: True success in enumeration comes from knowledge and analysis, beyond the tools used.

With these principles, enumeration becomes the foundation for effective penetration testing, enabling you to recognize and exploit potential vulnerabilities confidently.


# Introduction to Nmap

**Network Mapper (Nmap)** is an open-source tool for network analysis and security auditing, primarily used to:
- Identify available hosts on a network.
- Detect services and applications (including versions) running on hosts.
- Determine operating systems and configurations, such as firewalls or IDS settings.

## Use Cases
Nmap is widely used by network administrators and IT security professionals for:
- Security audits and vulnerability assessments.
- Penetration test simulations.
- Firewall and IDS verification.
- Network mapping and response analysis.
- Identifying open ports.

## Nmap Architecture
Nmap supports various scan types, each designed for specific tasks:
- **Host Discovery**: Finds active devices on the network.
- **Port Scanning**: Determines which ports are open.
- **Service Enumeration and Detection**: Identifies services and their versions.
- **OS Detection**: Determines the targetâ€™s operating system.
- **Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE)**: Allows custom interaction with services.

## Basic Syntax
The basic Nmap syntax is:
```bash
nmap <scan types> <options> <target>
```

## Scan Techniques
Nmap provides numerous scan techniques to suit different reconnaissance needs. Common scans include:
- **TCP SYN scan (-sS)**: Quickly scans thousands of ports without completing the full TCP handshake.
- **TCP Connect scan (-sT)**: Completes the full TCP handshake.
- **UDP scan (-sU)**: Probes open UDP ports.
- **Null, FIN, and Xmas scans (-sN, -sF, -sX)**: Evasion scans that send packets with unusual flags.
- **Idle scan (-sI)**: Uses a "zombie" host to hide the origin of the scan.
- **SCTP scan (-sY)**: Scans for SCTP services.

**Example of a TCP SYN Scan**:
```bash
sudo nmap -sS localhost
```
This command performs a SYN scan on the localhost. Ports respond as follows:
- **SYN-ACK**: Indicates the port is open.
- **RST**: Indicates the port is closed.
- **No response**: Marked as filtered, possibly due to firewall rules.

### Example Output
```bash
PORT     STATE SERVICE
22/tcp   open  ssh
80/tcp   open  http
5432/tcp open  postgresql
5901/tcp open  vnc-1
```
In this output, we see open TCP ports along with their corresponding services.

# Host Discovery with Nmap

**Host Discovery** is essential in internal penetration testing, especially when scanning a network to identify active systems. Nmap provides several options to determine if a target is online, with ICMP echo requests being one of the most effective methods.

## Recommended Practices
- Store each scan's results for documentation and comparison, as different tools may yield different outcomes.

## Key Host Discovery Techniques

1. **Scan a Network Range**:
   ```bash
   sudo nmap 10.129.2.0/24 -sn -oA tnet
   ```
   - `-sn`: Disables port scanning, focusing on host discovery.
   - `-oA tnet`: 	Stores the results in all formats starting with the name 'tnet'.

2. **Scan from an IP List**:
   Use a predefined list of IP addresses to check which hosts are active.
   ```bash
   sudo nmap -sn -oA tnet -iL hosts.lst
   ```
   - `-iL hosts.lst`: Scans targets from a file (hosts.lst).

3. **Scan Multiple IPs or a Range**:
   Scanning specific IPs or ranges is also possible by listing them directly or using a range.
   ```bash
   sudo nmap -sn -oA tnet 10.129.2.18-20
   ```

4. **Scan a Single IP**:
   For individual hosts, check if the target is online before conducting a full port scan.
   ```bash
   sudo nmap 10.129.2.18 -sn -oA host
   ```

   ```bash
   sudo nmap 10.129.2.18 -sn -oA host -PE --packet-trace 
   ```
   - `-oA host`: Stores the results in all formats starting with the name 'host'.
   - `-PE`: Performs the ping scan by using 'ICMP Echo requests' against the target.
   - `--packet-trace`: Shows all packets sent and received.
  
   ```bash
   sudo nmap 10.129.2.18 -sn -oA host -PE --reason 
   ```
   - `--reason`: Displays the reason for specific result.

## Advanced Options
- **ICMP Echo Requests (-PE)**: Ensures Nmap sends ICMP pings.
- **Packet Trace (--packet-trace)**: Shows all packets sent and received for detailed analysis.
- **Reason (--reason)**: Displays why Nmap identified a host as alive.
- **Disable ARP Ping (--disable-arp-ping)**: Avoids ARP requests to focus on ICMP.

**Example**:
```bash
sudo nmap 10.129.2.18 -sn -oA host -PE --packet-trace --disable-arp-ping
```
This command performs a detailed ICMP ping scan while disabling ARP requests, useful when the ARP ping is not required or interferes with results.

# Host and Port Scanning with Nmap

Effective host and port scanning with Nmap provides a deeper understanding of a target's open ports, services, service versions, and even operating system details.

## Port States in Nmap
Nmap identifies six possible states for scanned ports:
- **open**: Connection established (TCP, UDP, or SCTP).
- **closed**: Connection rejected with an RST flag (useful to confirm if a host is alive).
- **filtered**: No response; Nmap cannot determine if the port is open or closed, likely due to firewall rules.
- **unfiltered**: Only seen in TCP-ACK scans; indicates accessibility but unclear if open or closed.
- **open|filtered**: No response; suggests firewall or packet filtering.
- **closed|filtered**: Specific to IP ID idle scans; port state cannot be confirmed as closed or filtered.

## Key Scanning Techniques

### 1. Scanning Top TCP Ports
Scan the most common ports for a target.
```bash
sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 --top-ports=10
```

### 2. Detailed SYN Scan with Packet Tracing
View packet exchange details for deeper insights.
```bash
sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -p 21 --packet-trace -Pn -n --disable-arp-ping
```

### 3. TCP Connect Scan (-sT)
Uses a full three-way handshake to identify open/closed ports (high accuracy, low stealth).
```bash
sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -p 443 --packet-trace --disable-arp-ping -Pn -n --reason -sT
```

### 4. Handling Filtered Ports
Observe firewall behavior on ports, such as TCP port 139 (filtered state).
```bash
sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -p 139 --packet-trace -n --disable-arp-ping -Pn
```

### 5. Discovering Open UDP Ports
Since UDP does not use a handshake, it has a longer timeout and is slower to scan.
```bash
sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -F -sU
```

#### Advanced UDP Scan Example
Enables packet tracing and specific port selection with UDP scanning.
```bash
sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -sU -Pn -n --disable-arp-ping --packet-trace -p 137 --reason
```

### 6. Version Detection (-sV)
Provides detailed information about open ports, including service versions.
```bash
sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -Pn -n --disable-arp-ping --packet-trace -p 445 --reason -sV
```

## Important Options Explained
- **-sn**: Disables port scanning for host discovery only.
- **-Pn**: Disables ICMP echo requests.
- **-n**: Disables DNS resolution.
- **--packet-trace**: Shows all packets sent and received.
- **-sS / -sT / -sU**: SYN scan, TCP connect scan, and UDP scan, respectively.
- **-sV**: Detects service versions.
- **-p <port(s)>**: Specifies individual ports or ranges to scan.
- **--top-ports**: Scans the most common ports.
- **--reason**: Shows reasons for the port state.
- **--disable-arp-ping**: Disables ARP requests, focusing on ICMP pings.

Ejercicio1:
   Find all TCP ports on your target. Submit the total number of found TCP ports as the answer.
      ```nmap -vv -sT -p 1-65535 10.129.92.172``` 

Ejercicio2
   Enumerate the hostname of your target and submit it as the answer. (case-sensitive)
      ```nmap -vv -A -sV 10.129.92.172```

# Saving Nmap Results

When performing scans, it is essential to save results for documentation, comparison, and reporting purposes. Nmap supports saving output in three main formats.

## Nmap Output Formats
1. **Normal Output (-oN)**: Standard, human-readable output with `.nmap` extension.
2. **Grepable Output (-oG)**: Output in a format that can be parsed with tools like `grep`, saved with `.gnmap` extension.
3. **XML Output (-oX)**: XML format with `.xml` extension, useful for generating reports.

### Saving in All Formats
You can use `-oA` to save results in all three formats simultaneously. This command saves files with a specified prefix, for example:

```bash
sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -p- -oA target
```

In this case, the output files will be named `target.nmap`, `target.gnmap`, and `target.xml`.

### Example Output Files
After running the command, check the files in the current directory:

```bash
ls
# Output:
# target.gnmap target.xml target.nmap
```

## Examining Each Output Format

1. **Normal Output (.nmap)**:
   ```bash
   cat target.nmap
   ```
   Example contents:
   ```plaintext
   # Nmap scan report for 10.129.2.28
   PORT   STATE SERVICE
   22/tcp open  ssh
   25/tcp open  smtp
   80/tcp open  http
   ```

2. **Grepable Output (.gnmap)**:
   ```bash
   cat target.gnmap
   ```
   Example contents:
   ```plaintext
   Host: 10.129.2.28 ()  Ports: 22/open/tcp//ssh///, 25/open/tcp//smtp///, 80/open/tcp//http///
   ```

3. **XML Output (.xml)**:
   ```bash
   cat target.xml
   ```
   The XML format is detailed and can be converted to HTML for easier viewing.

## Converting XML to HTML
Use `xsltproc` to convert XML output to an HTML report:
```bash
xsltproc target.xml -o target.html
```

Open `target.html` in a browser for a structured, easy-to-read report.

Ejercicio1: 
   Perform a full TCP port scan on your target and create an HTML report. Submit the number of the highest port as the answer.
      ```nmap  -vv -sT -p 1-65535 10.129.55.118 -oA target```
      ```xsltproc target.xml -o target.html  ```
      ```31337```

# Service Enumeration with Nmap

Service enumeration is essential for identifying application versions, which enables vulnerability scanning and analysis for specific exploits.

## Key Steps in Service Enumeration

1. **Initial Port Scan**: Start with a quick scan to detect open ports without generating too much network traffic.
2. **Service Version Detection (-sV)**: Once open ports are identified, use `-sV` to determine service versions on each port.
3. **Detailed Scan with Progress Tracking**: During a scan, pressing the Space Bar or using `--stats-every=<time>` allows for monitoring the scanâ€™s progress.

### Commands for Service Enumeration

- **Full Port and Version Scan**:
  ```bash
  sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -p- -sV
  ```
  - `-p-`: Scans all ports.
  - `-sV`: Detects service versions.

- **Progress Update** (`--stats-every=5s`):
  ```bash
  sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -p- -sV --stats-every=5s
  ```
  - Shows scan status every 5 seconds.

- **Increase Verbosity (-v / -vv)**:
  ```bash
  sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -p- -sV -v
  ```
  - Increases output verbosity to display open ports in real-time.

## Banner Grabbing

Upon scan completion, Nmap displays TCP ports, services, and versions. Nmap primarily uses service banners to identify versions; if a banner is unavailable, it relies on signature-based matching, which can lengthen the scan.

Example Command:
```bash
sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -p- -sV -Pn -n --disable-arp-ping --packet-trace
```

## Useful Options

- **-Pn**: Disables ICMP Echo requests.
- **-n**: Disables DNS resolution.
- **--disable-arp-ping**: Avoids ARP pinging.
- **--packet-trace**: Shows all packets sent and received.
- **--reason**: Displays the reason for each port's state.

## Advanced Manual Banner Grabbing with `nc` and `tcpdump`

1. **Using netcat (nc)**:
   ```bash
   nc -nv 10.129.2.28 25
   ```

2. **Intercepting Traffic with tcpdump**:
   ```bash
   sudo tcpdump -i eth0 host 10.10.14.2 and 10.129.2.28
   ```

This manual approach helps capture additional information from service banners, often missed by automated scans.

Ejercicio1
    Enumerate all ports and their services. One of the services contains the flag you have to submit as the answer.
       ```nmap -vv -sV -A -p- 10.129.55.118```

# Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE)

The Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE) allows advanced interaction with services through scripts written in Lua. NSE scripts are organized into 14 categories.

## NSE Script Categories
| Category      | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| **auth**      | Authentication credentials determination. |
| **broadcast** | Host discovery by broadcasting. |
| **brute**     | Executes brute-force login attempts. |
| **default**   | Default scripts executed with the -sC option. |
| **discovery** | Evaluates accessible services. |
| **dos**       | Checks for denial of service vulnerabilities. |
| **exploit**   | Attempts to exploit known vulnerabilities. |
| **external**  | Uses external services for additional processing. |
| **fuzzer**    | Identifies vulnerabilities through fuzzing. |
| **intrusive** | Intrusive scripts potentially affecting the target. |
| **malware**   | Checks for malware on the target system. |
| **safe**      | Non-intrusive, defensive scripts. |
| **version**   | Extends service detection capabilities. |
| **vuln**      | Identifies specific vulnerabilities. |

## Running NSE Scripts

- **Default Scripts**:
  ```bash
  sudo nmap <target> -sC
  ```

- **Specific Script Category**:
  ```bash
  sudo nmap <target> --script <category>
  ```

- **Defined Scripts**:
  ```bash
  sudo nmap <target> --script <script-name>,<script-name>
  ```

### Example: Using Defined Scripts
To analyze an SMTP service, you might run:
```bash
sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -p 25 --script banner,smtp-commands
```
In this example, the `banner` script identifies the OS, while `smtp-commands` lists available commands.

## Aggressive Scanning (-A)

The aggressive scan option `-A` performs service detection, OS detection, traceroute, and default NSE scripts:
```bash
sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -p 80 -A
```

### Example Output (Aggressive Scan)
With `-A`, Nmap can reveal details such as the web server type (e.g., Apache 2.4.29), web application (e.g., WordPress 5.3.4), and likely OS (e.g., Linux).

## Vulnerability Scanning with NSE

The **vuln** script category checks services for known vulnerabilities. For example:
```bash
sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -p 80 -sV --script vuln
```
This command examines the web server on port 80 for potential vulnerabilities, displaying any CVE details if found.

## Additional NSE Script Documentation

For more information on NSE scripts and categories, visit the [Nmap NSE documentation](https://nmap.org/nsedoc/index.html).


Ejercicio1:
   Use NSE and its scripts to find the flag that one of the services contain and submit it as the answer.
      ```nmap -vv 10.129.55.118 --script vuln -p 80```
      ```curl http://10.129.55.118/robots.txt```

# Nmap Performance Optimization

## Overview
Optimizing Nmap performance is essential when scanning extensive networks or when dealing with limited bandwidth. Various settings can improve scan speed and efficiency, allowing you to balance precision with speed.

## Key Parameters for Optimization

### Timeout Settings
Adjusting timeouts can significantly reduce scan duration, but too short a timeout may miss active hosts. Use:
- `--min-rtt-timeout <time>`: Sets a minimum Round-Trip-Time for response.
- `--max-rtt-timeout <time>`: Sets a maximum Round-Trip-Time. 

**Example**:
```bash
sudo nmap 10.129.2.0/24 -F --initial-rtt-timeout 50ms --max-rtt-timeout 100ms
```

### Max Retries
You can control the retry rate for sent packets to save time, especially with unresponsive ports:
- `--max-retries <number>`: Defines the number of retries. Set to `0` to skip retries, which accelerates the scan but may miss closed ports.

**Example**:
```bash
sudo nmap 10.129.2.0/24 -F --max-retries 0
```

### Packet Rate
By setting a minimum rate for sending packets, you can speed up Nmap scans on networks with sufficient bandwidth.
- `--min-rate <number>`: Specifies the minimum number of packets sent per second.

**Example**:
```bash
sudo nmap 10.129.2.0/24 -F --min-rate 300
```

### Timing Templates
Nmap offers six timing templates to adjust scan aggressiveness:
- **-T 0** (paranoid), **-T 1** (sneaky), **-T 2** (polite): For slow, stealthy scans.
- **-T 3** (normal): Default setting.
- **-T 4** (aggressive), **-T 5** (insane): Fast scans that may trigger security systems.

**Example**:
```bash
sudo nmap 10.129.2.0/24 -F -T 5
```

## Example Commands

- **Quick Scan with Aggressive Timing and No Retries**:
  ```bash
  sudo nmap -T 4 --min-rate 300 --max-retries 0 10.129.2.0/24
  ```
  
- **Full Network Scan with Reduced Timeouts**:
  ```bash
  sudo nmap 10.129.2.0/24 -F --initial-rtt-timeout 50ms --max-rtt-timeout 100ms
  ```

## Summary
Optimizing performance settings in Nmap helps strike a balance between speed and thoroughness, especially in large or bandwidth-limited environments. Experiment with these options to find the best combination for your specific network scenario.

For more details, refer to the [Nmap documentation on performance and timing](https://nmap.org/book/performance-timing-templates.html).
