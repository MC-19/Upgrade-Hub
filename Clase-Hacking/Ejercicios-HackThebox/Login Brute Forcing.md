# Brute Forcing Overview

## Introduction
Keys and passwords, the modern equivalent of locks and combinations, secure the digital world. But what if someone tries every possible combination until they find the one that opens the door? That, in essence, is brute forcing.

## What is Brute Forcing?
In cybersecurity, brute forcing is a trial-and-error method used to crack passwords, login credentials, or encryption keys. It involves systematically trying every possible combination of characters until the correct one is found. The process can be likened to a thief trying every key on a giant keyring until they find the one that unlocks the treasure chest.

The success of a brute force attack depends on several factors, including:

- **The complexity of the password or key**: Longer passwords with a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols are exponentially more complex to crack.
- **The computational power available to the attacker**: Modern computers and specialized hardware can try billions of combinations per second, significantly reducing the time needed for a successful attack.
- **The security measures in place**: Account lockouts, CAPTCHAs, and other defenses can slow down or even thwart brute-force attempts.

## How Brute Forcing Works
The brute force process can be visualized as follows:

1. **Start**: The attacker initiates the brute force process, often with the aid of specialized software.
2. **Generate Possible Combination**: The software generates a potential password or key combination based on predefined parameters, such as character sets and length.
3. **Apply Combination**: The generated combination is attempted against the target system, such as a login form or encrypted file.
4. **Check if Successful**: The system evaluates the attempted combination. If it matches the stored password or key, access is granted. Otherwise, the process continues.
5. **Access Granted**: The attacker gains unauthorized access to the system or data.
6. **End**: The process repeats, generating and testing new combinations until either the correct one is found or the attacker gives up.

## Types of Brute Forcing
Brute forcing is not a monolithic entity but a collection of diverse techniques, each with its strengths, weaknesses, and ideal use cases. Understanding these variations is crucial for both attackers and defenders, as it enables the former to choose the most effective approach and the latter to implement targeted countermeasures.

| Method                 | Description                                                                                   | Example                                                                                       | Best Used When...                                                                           |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Simple Brute Force** | Systematically tries all possible combinations of characters within a defined character set.  | Trying all combinations of lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z' for passwords of length 4 to 6. | No prior information about the password is available, and computational resources are abundant. |
| **Dictionary Attack**  | Uses a pre-compiled list of common words, phrases, and passwords.                            | Trying passwords from a list like `rockyou.txt` against a login form.                        | The target will likely use a weak or easily guessable password based on common patterns.   |
| **Hybrid Attack**      | Combines elements of simple brute force and dictionary attacks.                              | Adding numbers or special characters to the end of words from a dictionary list.             | The target might use a slightly modified version of a common password.                     |
| **Credential Stuffing**| Leverages leaked credentials from one service to attempt access to other services.           | Using a list of usernames and passwords leaked from a data breach to try logging in.         | A large set of leaked credentials is available, and the target is suspected of reusing passwords. |
| **Password Spraying**  | Attempts a small set of commonly used passwords against a large number of usernames.         | Trying passwords like `password123` or `qwerty` across multiple accounts.                   | Account lockout policies are in place, and the attacker aims to avoid detection.            |
| **Rainbow Table Attack** | Uses pre-computed tables of password hashes to reverse hashes.                            | Pre-computing hashes for passwords and comparing them to captured hashes.                   | A large number of password hashes need to be cracked, and storage space is available.      |
| **Reverse Brute Force**| Targets a single password against multiple usernames.                                       | Using a leaked password to try logging into various accounts.                               | A strong suspicion exists that a particular password is reused across multiple accounts.   |
| **Distributed Brute Force** | Distributes the brute forcing workload across multiple devices.                        | Using a cluster of computers to accelerate the attack.                                      | The target password is highly complex, and single-machine computational power is insufficient. |

## The Role of Brute Forcing in Penetration Testing
Penetration testing, or ethical hacking, is a proactive cybersecurity measure that simulates real-world attacks to identify and address vulnerabilities before malicious actors can exploit them. Brute forcing is a crucial tool in this process, particularly when assessing the resilience of password-based authentication mechanisms.

Brute forcing is often employed in penetration testing when:

- **Other avenues are exhausted**: Initial attempts to gain access, such as exploiting known vulnerabilities or using social engineering, may fail. Brute forcing can act as a fallback.
- **Password policies are weak**: Systems with lax password policies are more susceptible to brute force attacks, exposing their vulnerabilities.
- **Specific accounts are targeted**: Penetration testers might focus on accounts with elevated privileges, tailoring brute force methods to compromise these accounts directly.

Understanding and simulating these techniques help organizations strengthen their defenses against potential attackers.

# Password Security Fundamentals

## The Importance of Strong Passwords
Passwords are the first line of defense in protecting sensitive information and systems. A strong password is a formidable barrier, making it significantly harder for attackers to gain unauthorized access through brute forcing or other techniques. The longer and more complex a password is, the more combinations an attacker has to try, exponentially increasing the time and resources required for a successful attack.

## The Anatomy of a Strong Password
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) provides guidelines for creating strong passwords. These guidelines emphasize the following characteristics:

- **Length**: The longer the password, the better. Aim for a minimum of 12 characters, but longer is always preferable. Each additional character dramatically increases the number of possible combinations.
- **Complexity**: Use uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Avoid predictable patterns or sequences.
- **Uniqueness**: Donâ€™t reuse passwords across different accounts. Each account should have its own unique password.
- **Randomness**: Avoid using dictionary words, personal information, or common phrases. Random passwords are harder to crack.

## Common Password Weaknesses
Despite the importance of strong passwords, many users still rely on weak and easily guessable passwords. Common weaknesses include:

- **Short Passwords**: Vulnerable due to fewer possible combinations.
- **Common Words and Phrases**: Susceptible to dictionary attacks.
- **Personal Information**: Easily guessed from publicly available data.
- **Reusing Passwords**: Puts multiple accounts at risk if one is compromised.
- **Predictable Patterns**: Simple patterns like `123456` or `password` are widely known to attackers.

## Password Policies
Organizations implement password policies to enforce the use of strong passwords. These policies typically include:

- **Minimum Length**: Specifies a minimum number of characters.
- **Complexity Requirements**: Mandates the inclusion of diverse character types.
- **Password Expiration**: Requires periodic password changes.
- **Password History**: Prevents reuse of recent passwords.

While these policies enhance security, they can lead to poor practices, such as writing passwords down or using slight variations. Balancing security with usability is key.

## The Perils of Default Credentials
Default passwords, pre-set by manufacturers, are a significant vulnerability. Attackers exploit these easily guessable credentials, often published in manuals or online. Examples include:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3eeb114d-58cb-4d1e-934b-d917ef5ee4e5)


### Why Default Credentials Are Risky
- **Predictable Usernames**: Common usernames like `admin` or `root` provide attackers with a starting point.
- **Ease of Automation**: Attackers use tools to automate attempts with known default credentials.

Changing default passwords and usernames is a simple yet effective defense against such attacks.

## Brute-forcing and Password Security
In a brute-force scenario, the strength of the target passwords becomes the attacker's primary obstacle:

- **Evaluating System Vulnerability**: Password policies and user behavior determine the likelihood of success.
- **Strategic Tool Selection**: Password complexity influences the tools and methods used.
- **Resource Allocation**: Time and computational power needed depend on password strength.
- **Exploiting Weak Points**: Default credentials are often the easiest entry points.

For penetration testers, understanding password security is essential for identifying vulnerabilities and informing strategies. For defenders, it highlights the importance of robust password practices and the role users play in securing sensitive information.

# Dictionary Attacks

## The Power of Words
The effectiveness of a dictionary attack lies in its ability to exploit the human tendency to prioritize memorable passwords over secure ones. Many individuals continue to use passwords based on readily available information such as dictionary words, common phrases, names, or predictable patterns. This predictability makes them vulnerable to dictionary attacks, where attackers systematically test a pre-defined list of potential passwords against the target system.

### Key Factors for Success
- **Quality of the Wordlist**: A well-crafted wordlist tailored to the target audience or system significantly increases the probability of success.
- **Understanding Human Behavior**: Attackers leverage insights into common password practices to refine their wordlists.
- **Targeted Wordlists**: Tailoring wordlists to specific contexts (e.g., gaming-related terms for gamers) improves attack efficiency.

### Brute Force vs. Dictionary Attack
| Feature            | Dictionary Attack                               | Brute Force Attack                              | Explanation                                                                                |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Efficiency**     | Faster and more resource-efficient             | Time-consuming and resource-intensive           | Dictionary attacks narrow the search space with a pre-defined list of likely passwords.    |
| **Targeting**      | Adaptable to specific targets or systems       | No inherent targeting capability                | Wordlists can incorporate context-specific information.                                    |
| **Effectiveness**  | Effective against weak or common passwords     | Effective against all passwords given time     | Dictionary attacks succeed quickly if the password is in the wordlist.                    |
| **Limitations**    | Ineffective against random, complex passwords  | Impractical for lengthy, complex passwords      | Truly random passwords render dictionary attacks futile.                                   |

### Example Scenario
An attacker targeting a company's login portal might construct a specialized wordlist incorporating:
- Common weak passwords (e.g., `password123`)
- Company-specific terms
- Employee or department names
- Industry-specific jargon

By using this targeted wordlist, the attacker increases their likelihood of success compared to a random brute-force attack.

## Building and Utilizing Wordlists

### Sources of Wordlists
- **Publicly Available Lists**: Repositories like [SecLists](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists) host diverse wordlists, including leaked passwords and default credentials.
- **Custom-Built Lists**: Penetration testers can create wordlists based on reconnaissance data, such as hobbies, interests, or known patterns.
- **Specialized Lists**: Tailored for specific industries, applications, or organizations.
- **Pre-existing Lists**: Common tools often include pre-packaged wordlists, such as `rockyou.txt`.

| Wordlist                        | Description                                               | Typical Use                                      | Source                       |
|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| **rockyou.txt**                 | Millions of leaked passwords from the RockYou breach      | Password brute force attacks                    | RockYou breach dataset       |
| **top-usernames-shortlist.txt** | Concise list of common usernames                         | Quick brute force username attempts             | SecLists                     |
| **2023-200_most_used_passwords.txt** | 200 most commonly used passwords as of 2023              | Targeting reused passwords                      | SecLists                     |
| **Default-Credentials/default-passwords.txt** | Default usernames and passwords for devices/software    | Trying default credentials                      | SecLists                     |

## Throwing a Dictionary at the Problem

The target system creates a route (`/dictionary`) to handle POST requests. It expects a `password` parameter in the request's form data. If the submitted password matches, it responds with a JSON object containing a success message and a flag. Otherwise, it returns a 401 Unauthorized error.

### Python Script for Dictionary Attack
The following Python script performs a dictionary attack against the `/dictionary` endpoint:

```python
import requests

ip = "127.0.0.1"  # Change this to your instance IP address
port = 1234       # Change this to your instance port number

# Download a list of common passwords from the web and split it into lines
passwords = requests.get("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/master/Passwords/500-worst-passwords.txt").text.splitlines()

# Try each password from the list
for password in passwords:
    print(f"Attempted password: {password}")

    # Send a POST request to the server with the password
    response = requests.post(f"http://{ip}:{port}/dictionary", data={'password': password})

    # Check if the server responds with success and contains the 'flag'
    if response.ok and 'flag' in response.json():
        print(f"Correct password found: {password}")
        print(f"Flag: {response.json()['flag']}")
        break
```

### Execution Example
Running the script:

```
DJMC@htb[/htb]$ python3 dictionary-solver.py

...
Attempted password: turtle
Attempted password: tiffany
Attempted password: golf
Attempted password: bear
Attempted password: tiger
Correct password found: tiger
Flag: HTB{...}
```

### Script Workflow
1. **Downloads Wordlist**: Fetches a list of 500 weak passwords from SecLists.
2. **Iterates and Submits**: Tests each password by sending a POST request to the `/dictionary` endpoint.
3. **Analyzes Responses**: Checks if the response indicates success (HTTP 200) and extracts the flag if found.
4. **Continues or Terminates**: Iterates until the correct password is found or the wordlist is exhausted.

This example demonstrates how dictionary attacks exploit predictable passwords and underscores the necessity of robust password policies to mitigate such vulnerabilities.

# Hybrid Attacks

## The Problem of Predictable Password Patterns
Many organizations implement policies requiring users to change their passwords periodically to enhance security. Unfortunately, these policies can inadvertently encourage predictable password patterns if users are not adequately educated on proper password hygiene.

A widespread and insecure practice among users is making minor modifications to their passwords when forced to change them. For instance, a user might:
- Change `Summer2023` to `Summer2023!`
- Update `Summer2023` to `Summer2024`

This predictable behavior creates a loophole that hybrid attacks can exploit. Hybrid attacks combine the strengths of dictionary and brute-force methods, targeting these common patterns.

## Hybrid Attacks in Action
### Practical Example
Consider an attacker targeting an organization known to enforce regular password changes:
1. **Phase 1: Dictionary Attack**
   - The attacker uses a curated wordlist with common passwords, industry-specific terms, and personal information.
   - Quickly identifies any weak or guessable passwords.

2. **Phase 2: Targeted Brute Force**
   - If unsuccessful, the attacker transitions to a hybrid approach.
   - Modifies words from the original wordlist by appending numbers, special characters, or incrementing years (e.g., `Summer2023` â†’ `Summer2023!` â†’ `Summer2024`).

This reduces the search space compared to traditional brute-force attacks, improving efficiency while retaining high success rates.

## Advantages of Hybrid Attacks
- **Efficiency**: Narrowed search space compared to brute-force attacks.
- **Adaptability**: Can target known user behaviors or organizational patterns.
- **Effectiveness**: Particularly potent against predictable password modifications.

## Practical Implementation
### Scenario: Filtering a Wordlist Against a Password Policy
#### Password Policy Requirements
- Minimum length: 8 characters
- Must include:
  - At least one uppercase letter
  - At least one lowercase letter
  - At least one number

#### Steps
1. **Download the Wordlist**

```bash
DJMC@htb[/htb]$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/refs/heads/master/Passwords/darkweb2017-top10000.txt
```

2. **Filter by Minimum Length**

```bash
DJMC@htb[/htb]$ grep -E '^.{8,}$' darkweb2017-top10000.txt > darkweb2017-minlength.txt
```

3. **Filter for Uppercase Letters**

```bash
DJMC@htb[/htb]$ grep -E '[A-Z]' darkweb2017-minlength.txt > darkweb2017-uppercase.txt
```

4. **Filter for Lowercase Letters**

```bash
DJMC@htb[/htb]$ grep -E '[a-z]' darkweb2017-uppercase.txt > darkweb2017-lowercase.txt
```

5. **Filter for Numerical Characters**

```bash
DJMC@htb[/htb]$ grep -E '[0-9]' darkweb2017-lowercase.txt > darkweb2017-number.txt
```

6. **Count Remaining Passwords**

```bash
DJMC@htb[/htb]$ wc -l darkweb2017-number.txt
89 darkweb2017-number.txt
```

By filtering a 10,000-password list, we narrow it down to 89 entries. This smaller, targeted list is more efficient for cracking attempts.

## Credential Stuffing: Leveraging Stolen Data
Credential stuffing exploits the common practice of reusing passwords across multiple online accounts.

### Attack Stages
1. **Acquire Credentials**:
   - Gather username-password pairs from breaches, phishing, or malware.
   - Use publicly available lists, such as `rockyou` or SecLists datasets.

2. **Select Targets**:
   - Focus on services likely tied to the credentials (e.g., social media, email, banking).

3. **Automate Testing**:
   - Use tools to systematically test credentials, mimicking normal user behavior to avoid detection.

### Impact
- **Unauthorized Access**: Data theft, identity fraud, financial crimes.
- **Domino Effect**: Compromising one account often compromises others due to password reuse.

### Prevention Tips
- Use unique passwords for every account.
- Employ multi-factor authentication.
- Educate users about password hygiene.

Credential stuffing highlights the importance of strong, unique passwords and proactive security measures to safeguard online accounts.

# Basic HTTP Authentication

## Overview
Web applications often employ authentication mechanisms to protect sensitive data and functionalities. **Basic HTTP Authentication** (Basic Auth) is a rudimentary yet common method for securing resources on the web. While easy to implement, its inherent vulnerabilities make it a frequent target for brute-force attacks.

### How It Works
Basic Auth is a challenge-response protocol:
1. **Access Attempt**: A user tries to access a restricted area.
2. **Server Challenge**: The server responds with a `401 Unauthorized` status and a `WWW-Authenticate` header prompting the browser to present a login dialog.
3. **Credentials Submission**: The user provides a username and password, which the browser concatenates into a string (e.g., `username:password`).
4. **Base64 Encoding**: The string is encoded using Base64 and included in the `Authorization` header of subsequent requests:

    ```http
    GET /protected_resource HTTP/1.1
    Host: www.example.com
    Authorization: Basic YWxpY2U6c2VjcmV0MTIz
    ```
5. **Server Validation**: The server decodes the credentials, verifies them, and grants or denies access.

Beyond the realm of Basic HTTP Authentication, many web applications employ custom login forms as their primary authentication mechanism. These forms, while visually diverse, often share common underlying mechanics that make them targets for brute-forcing.

### Understanding Login Forms
Login forms are HTML-based structures embedded within web pages. They typically include:
- Input fields (`<input>`) for capturing the username and password.
- A submit button (`<button>` or `<input type="submit">`) to initiate the authentication process.

### Example Login Form
```html
<form action="/login" method="post">
  <label for="username">Username:</label>
  <input type="text" id="username" name="username"><br><br>
  <label for="password">Password:</label>
  <input type="password" id="password" name="password"><br><br>
  <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>
```

### Example HTTP POST Request
```http
POST /login HTTP/1.1
Host: www.example.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 29

username=john&password=secret123
```

### Key Details
- **Method**: `POST`
- **Path**: `/login`
- **Headers**: `Content-Type`, `Content-Length`
- **Body**: Username and password encoded as key-value pairs.

## Brute-Forcing Login Forms with Hydra

Hydraâ€™s `http-post-form` module targets login forms by automating POST requests and dynamically substituting username and password combinations.

### Hydra Command Structure
```bash
hydra [options] target http-post-form "path:params:condition_string"
```

#### Understanding the Condition String
- **Failure Condition (F=...)**: Identifies a failed login attempt by checking for specific text in the response (e.g., `F=Invalid credentials`).
- **Success Condition (S=...)**: Identifies a successful login attempt by checking for specific text or status codes (e.g., `S=302` or `S=Dashboard`).

#### Example Conditions
- Failure: `F=Invalid credentials`
- Success by status: `S=302`
- Success by content: `S=Dashboard`

---

## Steps to Use Hydra

### 1. Inspect the Login Form
Use browser developer tools to analyze the formâ€™s structure:
- **Method**: `POST`
- **Fields**: `username`, `password`
- **Endpoint**: `/`

#### Example HTML
```html
<form method="POST">
    <h2>Login</h2>
    <label for="username">Username:</label>
    <input type="text" id="username" name="username">
    <label for="password">Password:</label>
    <input type="password" id="password" name="password">
    <input type="submit" value="Login">
</form>
```

#### Analyze the Request
Submit sample credentials and check the request data using developer tools or a proxy tool like Burp Suite:
- **Path**: `/`
- **Fields**: `username`, `password`
- **Error Message**: "Invalid credentials"

### 2. Construct the Params String
Based on the analysis, construct the `params` string for Hydra:
```bash
/:username=^USER^&password=^PASS^:F=Invalid credentials
```
- **Path**: `/`
- **Fields**: `username`, `password`
- **Failure Condition**: `F=Invalid credentials`

DJMC@htb[/htb]$ git clone https://github.com/urbanadventurer/username-anarchy.git
DJMC@htb[/htb]$ cd username-anarchy
```

### Generating Usernames
Run Username Anarchy with the targetâ€™s first and last names:
```bash
DJMC@htb[/htb]$ ./username-anarchy Jane Smith > jane_smith_usernames.txt
```

Generated usernames may include:
- `janesmith`, `smithjane`, `j.smith`
- `janemarie`, `smithj87`
- Leetspeak variations like `j4n3`, `5m1th`

---

## Password Generation with CUPP
CUPP (Common User Passwords Profiler) creates personalized password wordlists based on gathered intelligence. The more information you provide, the more effective the list.

### Installing CUPP
```bash
DJMC@htb[/htb]$ sudo apt install cupp -y
```

### Example Profile for Jane Smith
| Field                   | Details             |
|-------------------------|---------------------|
| Name                   | Jane Smith          |
| Nickname               | Janey               |
| Birthdate              | December 11, 1990  |
| Partnerâ€™s Name         | Jim (Nickname: Jimbo)|

| Pet                   | Spot                |
| Company               | AHI                 |
| Interests              | Hackers, Pizza, Golf|
| Favorite Colors        | Blue                |

Run CUPP interactively:
```bash
DJMC@htb[/htb]$ cupp -i
```
Answer the prompts with details about Jane Smith. CUPP will generate a comprehensive password list (`jane.txt`) including:
- Variations: `jane1990`, `smith2708`
- Leetspeak: `j4n3`, `5m1th`
- Mutations: `Jane1990!`, `smith2708@`

### Filtering Passwords to Match Policies
If Jane's company has a password policy, filter the list to match:
- Minimum 6 characters
- At least one uppercase, lowercase, number, and two special characters (!@#$%^&*)

```bash
DJMC@htb[/htb]$ grep -E '^.{6,}$' jane.txt | grep -E '[A-Z]' | grep -E '[a-z]' | grep -E '[0-9]' | grep -E '([!@#$%^&*].*){2,}' > jane-filtered.txt
```

---

## Combining Wordlists with Hydra
Use the generated username and password lists in Hydra:
```bash
DJMC@htb[/htb]$ hydra -L jane_smith_usernames.txt -P jane-filtered.txt IP -s PORT -f http-post-form "/:username=^USER^&password=^PASS^:Invalid credentials"
