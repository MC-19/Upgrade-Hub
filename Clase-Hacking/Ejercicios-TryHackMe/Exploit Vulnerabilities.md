# Vulnerability Scanning: Tools and Techniques

Cybersecurity offers a wide range of tools and services for vulnerability scanning, from commercial to open-source solutions. These tools help identify application flaws efficiently.

---

## Example: Nessus Vulnerability Scanner
- Offers both free (community) and commercial editions.
- The commercial version, often used by organizations, costs thousands for a yearly license.
- **Note**: Check the TryHackMe room dedicated to Nessus for more information.

## Advantages and Disadvantages of Vulnerability Scanners
| **Advantages**                              | **Disadvantages**                                                                           |
|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Automated scans are easy to repeat and share.| Users may become overly reliant on tools.                                                 |
| Scanners are fast and test many applications.| They generate significant traffic, which can trigger firewalls and logs.                   |
| Open-source solutions are available.         | Open-source tools are often basic, requiring costly licenses for advanced features.        |
| Cover a wide range of vulnerabilities.       | Do not detect every vulnerability on an application.                                       |

## Manual vs Automated Scanning
- **Automated Scanning**:
  - Quick and efficient for broad assessments.
  - Examples: Metasploit vulnerability scanning modules.
- **Manual Scanning**:
  - Preferred for detailed testing of individual applications or programs.
  - Similar techniques to automated scanning but more precise.

## Common Vulnerabilities Found in Scanning
| **Vulnerability**         | **Description**                                                                 |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Security Misconfigurations** | Vulnerabilities due to developer oversight, such as exposed server information.  |
| **Broken Access Control**  | Allows attackers to access restricted areas of an application.                   |
| **Insecure Deserialization** | Poor processing of data transmitted across the application, enabling malicious code execution. |
| **Injection**              | Allows malicious data input due to unsanitized inputs (e.g., SQL Injection).      |

# Tools for Vulnerability Research and Exploitation

## Rapid7
- Acts as both a **vulnerability research database** and an **exploit database**.
- Allows filtering by vulnerability type (e.g., application, operating system).
- Includes instructions for using vulnerabilities with the **Metasploit** tool.
- Example: Entry for "Wordpress Plugin SP Project & Document" with Metasploit usage instructions.

---

## GitHub
- A popular platform for hosting and sharing source code, also used by security researchers.
- **Key Features**:
  - Hosts **Proof of Concepts (PoCs)** for vulnerabilities.
  - Allows searching by keywords (e.g., "PoC", "vulnerability", "CVE").
  - At the time of writing, 9,682 repositories are tagged with "CVE".
  - Filters results by programming language.
- **Advantages**:
  - Useful for finding rare or recent exploits.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - PoCs may lack support or reliability due to the open nature of contributions.

---

## Searchsploit
- An offline tool available on pentesting distributions like Kali Linux and the TryHackMe AttackBox.
- An offline copy of Exploit-DB, enabling searches without internet access.
- **Search by**:
  - Application name.
  - Vulnerability type.
- **Example Usage**:
  ```bash
  searchsploit wordpress
  ```
  This command retrieves exploits for WordPress, such as:
  - Arbitrary file uploads.
  - SQL injection.
  - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

---

**Key Takeaway**: Use these tools to enhance your vulnerability research:
- **Rapid7** for exploits integrated with Metasploit.
- **GitHub** for recent and diverse PoCs.
- **Searchsploit** for offline searches on Exploit-DB.


# Exploiting Vulnerable Services: Command Execution

One of the most effective vulnerabilities to exploit is the ability to execute commands on the target running the vulnerable application or service. This allows actions such as:
- Reading restricted files.
- Executing commands otherwise not possible through the application.
- Gaining a **foothold** to the machine for further exploitation.

---

## Exploit Configuration
Exploits rarely work out-of-the-box and often require configuration to fit the target environment. The level of customization depends on the exploit and the specific vulnerability.

### Example: Modifying an Exploit
**Before Configuration**:
```python
nano exploit.py
mymachine="192.168.1.10"
port="1337"
```
**After Configuration**:
```python
nano exploit.py
mymachine="10.13.37.10"
port="1337"
```

### Understanding Exploit Usage
Run `--help` to list required arguments for the exploit:
```bash
exploit.py --help
To use this exploit, provide the following arguments:
-u The URL of the application
-c The command you wish to execute
```

---

## Exploiting the Vulnerability
1. **Upload a Malicious File**:
   - Use the exploit to upload a file containing the command to execute.
   - The vulnerable server will execute this file.

2. **Verify Exploit Success**:
   - Run a basic command to confirm execution:
     ```bash
     exploit.py -u http://10.10.10.10 -c "whoami"
     ```
     **Output**: `www-data`

3. **Execute Further Commands**:
   - Read a file from the target machine:
     ```bash
     exploit.py -u http://10.10.10.10 -c "cat flag.txt"
     ```
     **Output**: `THM{EXPLOIT_COMPLETE}`

---

## Key Takeaways
- Customization is essential for successful exploitation.
- Proper understanding of the exploit's configuration and arguments is critical.
- Gaining command execution enables advanced exploitation of the target machine.
