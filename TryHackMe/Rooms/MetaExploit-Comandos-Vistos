Metasploit has two main versions:
  Metasploit Pro: The commercial version that facilitates the automation and management of tasks. This version has a graphical user interface (GUI).
  Metasploit Framework: The open-source version that works from the command line. This room will focus on this version, installed on the AttackBox and most commonly used penetration testing Linux distributions.

  The Metasploit Framework is a set of tools that allow information gathering, scanning, exploitation, exploit development, post-exploitation, and more. 
  While the primary usage of the Metasploit Framework focuses on the penetration testing domain, it is also useful for vulnerability research and exploit development.

Before diving into modules, it would be helpful to clarify a few recurring concepts: vulnerability, exploit, and payload.

Exploit: A piece of code that uses a vulnerability present on the target system.
Vulnerability: A design, coding, or logic flaw affecting the target system. The exploitation of a vulnerability can result in disclosing confidential information or allowing the attacker to execute code on the target system.
Payload: An exploit will take advantage of a vulnerability. However, if we want the exploit to have the result we want (gaining access to the target system, read confidential information, etc.), we need to use a payload. Payloads are the code that will run on the target system.

Payloads
      Adapters: An adapter wraps single payloads to convert them into different formats. For example, a normal single payload can be wrapped inside a Powershell adapter, which will make a single powershell command that will execute the payload.
      Singles: Self-contained payloads (add user, launch notepad.exe, etc.) that do not need to download an additional component to run.
      Stagers: Responsible for setting up a connection channel between Metasploit and the target system. Useful when working with staged payloads. “Staged payloads” will first upload a stager on the target system then download the rest of the payload (stage). This provides some advantages as the initial size of the payload will be relatively small compared to the full payload sent at once.
      Stages: Downloaded by the stager. This will allow you to use larger sized payloads.

  search
    The output of the search command provides an overview of each returned module. You may notice the “name” column already gives more information than just the module name. You can see the type of module (auxiliary, exploit, etc.) and the category of the module (scanner, admin, windows, Unix, etc.). You can use any module returned in a search result with the command use followed by the number at the beginning of the result line. (e.g. use 0 instead of use auxiliary/admin/smb/ms17_010_command)
