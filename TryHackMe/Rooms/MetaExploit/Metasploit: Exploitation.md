# Introduction to Metasploit for Vulnerability Scanning and Exploitation

In this room, we will explore how to effectively use Metasploit for vulnerability scanning, exploitation, database management, and payload generation. Below are the key topics that will be covered.

## Key Topics Covered

1. **Scanning Target Systems**
2. **Metasploit Database Feature**
3. **Conducting Vulnerability Scans**
4. **Exploiting Vulnerable Services**
5. **Creating Payloads with msfvenom**

## Important Note

For questions that require a wordlist (e.g., brute-force attacks), use the wordlist located at:

```bash
/usr/share/wordlists/MetasploitRoom/MetasploitWordlist.txt
```
To get started, launch the AttackBox and run Metasploit with the command: ```msfconsole```

# Port Scanning 

Metasploit has a number of modules to scan open ports on the target system and network. You can list potential port scanning modules available using the ```search portscan``` command.

Port scanning modules will require you to set a few options:
  CONCURRENCY: Number of targets to be scanned simultaneously.
  PORTS: Port range to be scanned. Please note that 1-1000 here will not be the same as using Nmap with the default configuration. Nmap will scan the 1000 most used ports, while Metasploit will scan port numbers from 1 to 10000.
  RHOSTS: Target or target network to be scanned.
  THREADS: Number of threads that will be used simultaneously. More threads will result in faster scans.
  You can directly perform Nmap scans from the msfconsole prompt as shown below faster:

UDP service Identification

The ```scanner/discovery/udp_sweep``` module will allow you to quickly identify services running over the UDP (User Datagram Protocol). As you can see below, this module will not conduct an extensive scan of all possible UDP services but does provide a quick way to identify services such as DNS or NetBIOS.

SMB Scans
Metasploit offers several useful auxiliary modules that allow us to scan specific services. Below is an example for the SMB. Especially useful in a corporate network would be ```smb_enumshares``` and ```smb_version``` but please spend some time to identify scanners that the Metasploit version installed on your system offers.
