Managing Processes
  SIGTERM - Kill the process, but allow it to do some cleanup tasks beforehand
  SIGKILL - Kill the process - doesn't do any cleanup after the fact
  SIGSTOP - Stop/suspend a process


Getting Processes/Services to Start on Boot
  systemctl -- this command allows us to interact with the systemd process/daemon. 
    systemctl [option] [service]

  For example, to tell apache to start up, we'll use systemctl start apache2. 
  Seems simple enough, right? Same with if we wanted to stop apache, we'd just replace the [option] with stop (instead of start like we provided)
  
  We can do four options with systemctl:
  
  Start
  Stop
  Enable
  Disable


Foregrounding a process
  With our process backgrounded using either Ctrl + Z or the & operator, we can use fg to bring this back to focus like below, 
  where we can see the fg command is being used to bring the background process back into use on the terminal, where the output of the script is now returned to us.


crontab
  A crontab is simply a special file with formatting that is recognised by the cron process to execute each line step-by-step. Crontabs require 6 specific values:

Value	Description
MIN	  What minute to execute at
HOUR	What hour to execute at
DOM	  What day of the month to execute at
MON	  What month of the year to execute at
DOW	  What day of the week to execute at
CMD	  The actual command that will be executed.
